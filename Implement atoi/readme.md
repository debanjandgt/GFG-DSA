Given a string, s, the objective is to convert it into integer format without utilizing any built-in functions. If the conversion is not feasible, the function should return -1.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "-123"
Output: 
-123
Explanation:
It is possible to convert -123 into an integer 
and is so returned in the form of an integer
Example 2:

Input:
s = "21a"
Output: 
-1
Explanation: 
The output is -1 as, due to the inclusion of 'a',
the given string cannot be converted to an integer.
Your Task:
You do not have to take any input or print anything. Complete the function atoi() which takes a string s as an input parameter and returns an integer value representing the given string. If the conversion is not feasible, the function should return -1.
