Shortest path in Directed Acyclic Graph

https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shortest-path-in-undirected-graph/1

Given a Directed Acyclic Graph of N vertices from 0 to N-1 and a 2D Integer array(or vector) edges[ ][ ] of length M, where there is a directed edge from edge[i][0] to edge[i][1] with a distance of edge[i][2] for all i, 0<=i

Find the shortest path from src(0) vertex to all the vertices and if it is impossible to reach any vertex, then return -1 for that vertex.

 

Example:

Input:
n = 6, m= 7
edge=[[0,1,2],[0,4,1],[4,5,4]
,[4,2,2],[1,2,3],[2,3,6],[5,3,1]]

Output:
0 2 3 6 1 5
