https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-triplets-with-zero-sum/1

Given an array arr[] of n integers. Check whether it contains a triplet that sums up to zero. 

Note: Return 1, if there is at least one triplet following the condition else return 0.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0, -1 and 1 forms a triplet
with sum equal to 0.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 0
Explanation: No triplet with zero sum exists.
