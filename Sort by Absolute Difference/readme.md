https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-by-absolute-difference-1587115621/1?utm_source=gfg&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=bottom_sticky_on_article

Given an array of N elements and a number K. The task is to arrange array elements according to the absolute difference with K, i. e., element having minimum difference comes first and so on.
Note : If two or more elements are at equal distance arrange them in same sequence as in the given array.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 5, K = 7
arr[] = {10, 5, 3, 9, 2}
Output: 5 9 10 3 2
Explanation: Sorting the numbers accoding to 
the absolute difference with 7, we have 
array elements as 5, 9, 10, 3, 2.
Example 2:

Input: N = 5, K = 6
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 5 4 3 2 1
Explanation: Sorting the numbers according to 
the absolute difference with 6, we have array 
elements as 5 4 3 2 1.

Your Task:
This is a functional problem. You only need to complete the function sortABS(). The printing is done automatically by the driver code.
