Distance from the Source (Bellman-Ford Algorithm)

https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/distance-from-the-source-bellman-ford-algorithm/1

Given a weighted, directed and connected graph of V vertices and E edges, Find the shortest distance of all the vertex's from the source vertex S.
Note: If the Graph contains a negative cycle then return an array consisting of only -1.

Example 1:

Input:

E = [[0,1,9]]
S = 0
Output:
0 9
Explanation:
Shortest distance of all nodes from
source is printed.
Example 2:

Input:

E = [[0,1,5],[1,0,3],[1,2,-1],[2,0,1]]
S = 2
Output:
1 6 0
Explanation:
For nodes 2 to 0, we can follow the path-
2-0. This has a distance of 1.
For nodes 2 to 1, we cam follow the path-
2-0-1, which has a distance of 1+5 = 6,
