Topological sort

https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/topological-sort/1

Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with V vertices and E edges, Find any Topological Sorting of that Graph.


Example 1:

Input:

Output:
1
Explanation:
The output 1 denotes that the order is
valid. So, if you have, implemented
your function correctly, then output
would be 1 for all test cases.
One possible Topological order for the
graph is 3, 2, 1, 0.
Example 2:

Input:

Output:
1
Explanation:
The output 1 denotes that the order is
valid. So, if you have, implemented
your function correctly, then output
would be 1 for all test cases.
One possible Topological order for the
graph is 5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 0.
